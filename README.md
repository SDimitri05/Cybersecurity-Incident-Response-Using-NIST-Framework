# Cybersecurity Incident Response Using NIST Framework.

Applied NIST Cybersecurity Framework to Analyze and Mitigate a DDoS Attack.

Led a comprehensive analysis and response to a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targeting a multimedia company’s internal network,causing a two-hour service disruption. Utilizing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), I identified the attack vector—a flood of ICMP packetsexploiting an unconfigured firewall vulnerability—and assessed impacted network systems. I developed and implemented a protection planincluding firewall rule updates, source IP verification, and deployment of IDS/IPS and network monitoring tools to detect and mitigate similarthreats. This project enhanced my skills in incident identification, response planning, and recovery strategies, while reinforcing best practices incybersecurity risk management and continuous monitoring.
